This was a neat project, and relatively quick.  It took one day to dig the foundation in and two days to build the structure. 
They were also short days (~6 hours) because of winter cold/dark.  There was some time in between to let the adhesive between the blocks cure.

I did all the work by myself, except borrowing someone occasionally to tip the fully assembled structure onto the blocks.  With more than one person, you could probably knock this out in one day for the foundation and one day for construction.  I used a lot of clamps to position lumber and hold it in place while drilling and screwing. Clamping the polycarbonate roofing when cutting it was a big help.

Toolwise, I used a mitre saw, cordless drill/driver, jigsaw (for the polycarb roofing), hammer drill (for the tapcons in the foundation), tape measure, speed square.  You could do all the cutting the with a circular saw, a jigsaw, or even a hand saw if you had to.

I use treated lumber to keep costs down (vs cedar).  The slats and deck are deck boards (6 x 5/4 treated, rounded edges) which is, ironically cheaper than 1x6 treated boards, even though they are thinner.  I used Deckmate yellow-coated screws, except for the special screws for the polycarbonate roofing.  Total cost was probably ~$250 US, so more expensive than a commercial (metal) wood rack, but I like the look of it much better, and most of the commercial options have a canvas cover or tarp instead of a roof.

Note: It's important to predrill any holes near the edge of a board to prevent splitting.

It turned out to be challenging to get the roof angle correct.  I tried cutting the columns at the angle from the model, then using the roof frame to true up the columns, but it was hard to get everything aligned, and mine is not perfect.

I added 2x4 cross-braces at the top of the frame to the model and the cut list (they are not in my build).  If I was doing it again, I would use those braces to make the frame square and plumb without the roof and leave the columns long (not cut at an angle).  Then I would attach the roof frame at the desired angle and cut the columns off flush with a handsaw or circular saw.
